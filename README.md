# Callbacky

**Callbacky** is a lightweight Ruby gem that allows you to define and run custom lifecycle callbacks like `before` and `after` in a clean, expressive way.

## âœ¨ Features

- Define custom `before_*` and `after_*` hooks
- Supports callbacks as method names, lambdas, or blocks
- Declarative syntax inspired by Rails
- Easily extensible for any lifecycle events in your application

## Installation

Add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "callbacky"
```

Or install manually:

```sh
gem install callbacky
```

## Usage

### 1. Include `Callbacky` in your class
```ruby
class MyService
  include Callbacky
end
```
### 2. Define callbacks

***Using method name:***
```ruby
class MyService
  include Callbacky

  callbacky :before, :init, :prepare_context
  callbacky :after, :init, ->(obj) { obj.log_init }

  callbacky :after, :init do |instance|
    instance.send_metrics
  end

  def prepare_context
    puts "Preparing context"
  end

  def log_init
    puts "Logged init"
  end

  def send_metrics
    puts "Sent metrics"
  end
end

```

### 3. Trigger the callback

```ruby
class MyService
  def initialize
    callbacky_init
      do_work
    end
  end

  def do_work
    puts "Doing the actual work"
  end
end

```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
