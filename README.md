# Callbacky

**Callbacky** is a lightweight Ruby gem that allows you to define and run custom lifecycle callbacks like `before` and `after` in a clean, expressive way.

## âœ¨ Features

- Define custom `before_*` and `after_*` hooks
- Supports callbacks as method names, lambdas, or blocks
- Declarative syntax inspired by Rails
- Easily extensible for any lifecycle events in your application

## Installation

Add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "callbacky"
```

Or install manually:

```sh
gem install callbacky
```

## Usage

### 1. Extend `Callbacky` in your class
```ruby
class MyService
  class << self
    extend Callbacky

    callbacky_after :init
  end
end
```
### 2. Define a callback

***Using method name:***
```ruby
class MyService
  callbacky_after_init :handle_after_init

  def handle_after_init
    puts "After init"
  end
end
```

***Using a lambda or proc:***
```ruby
class MyService
  callbacky_after_init ->(obj) { obj.log_event }
end
```

***Using a block:***
```ruby
class MyService
  callbacky_after_init do |instance|
    instance.send_metrics
  end
end
```

### 3. Trigger the callback

```ruby
class MyService
  def initializer
    ### callbacky_init will run before and after hooks
    callbacky_init do |instance|
      instance.do_some_other_things_inside
    end
  end
end
```
